# spatial fuzzification
This repository contains QGIS models that allow fuzzifying different spatial data types by using "S-shape" and linear functions.

While "Fuzzification_Linear" model allows to use linear function, "Fuzzification_S" model can be applied to use "S-shape" function.

The models can be added to QGIS by putting files into model directory. This directory is "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\processing\models" if is not changed.
