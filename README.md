# QGIS Spatial Fuzzification
This repository contains QGIS models that allow for fuzzifying different spatial data types by using s-function and linear function.

The models can be integrated to QGIS by adding files into model directory. The default directory is "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\processing\models" if it is not changed.
